SOLID
S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    Each software module should have one and only one reason to change
    A module can refer to a class or a single function
    One Purpose
        Multipurpose tools don't perform as well as dedicated tools.
        Dedicated tools are easier to use
        A Problem with one part of a multipurpose tool can impact all parts
    
    What is a Responsibility?
        It is the class or function's task or purpose.
        It is to make sure that we model the business problem correctly.
        
    Reason to Change:
        Each module should have one responsibility.
        Responsibilities change at different times for different reasons.
        Each responsibility is a another/different axis of change.
            Axis of Change:
                Each stakeholder has different requirements and responsibilities they want to integrate into the software.
    
    SRP helps to create High Cohesion and Loose Coupling
O: Open Close Principle (OCP)
L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

When to use SOLID?
You should use SOLID in a PDD Approach
PDD - Pain Driven Development
  Write your code using the simplest way you know how
Avoid Premature Optimization
If your current design is painful to work with, use the SOLID principles to guide redesign
Don't try to implement SOLID upfront, use them to eleminate pain and improve the software.

Tight Coupling:
    Binds two (or more) details together in a way that's difficult to change.
    
Loose Coupling:
    Offers a modular way to choose which details are involved in a particular operation.
    
Separation of Concern:
    Programs should be separated into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern, or set of information that affects the program.

Relationship between classes represent coupling
Coupling is Cohesion but between classes

Keep classes small, focused, and testable.
