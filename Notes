What is Dependency Injection (AKA DI)?
Dependency Injection is a set of software design principles and patterns that enable us to develop loosely coupled code.
The goal with DI is to have loosely coupled code.

Why do we want Loosely Coupled Code?
Bc is it easy to extend, easy to test, easy to maintain, and it facitilates parrelel development.

Dependency Inject Patterns:
Constructor Injection
Property Injection
Method Injection
Ambient Context
Service Locator

Construciton and Constructor are the most useful (for most people) and that is what these notes will focus on.

Application Layers:
View -> UI Elements
Presentation -> UI Logic
Data Access -> Think API
Data Store -> Think DB like AWS or GCP

MVVM
Model - View - ViewModel
Model: Everything Else: meaning all other logic and db calls
View: UI
ViewModel: Presentation Logic
